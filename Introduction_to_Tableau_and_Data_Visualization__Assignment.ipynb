        "Business Scenario: You are a Data Analyst at an e-commerce company that sells home decor and gifts across multiple countries. The leadership team is concerned about customer churn and revenue loss due to inconsistent customer behavior. They’ve asked you to investigate patterns in customer orders, returns, and geographic sales performance from the Online Retail II dataset. Your Task in Tableau: 1. Use Tableau to answer these questions: ○ Which countries have the highest number of repeat customers? ○ What is the return rate by product and Find top 10 countries? ○ What time of year do customers tend to buy the most (Seasonality) ? ○ Are there certain customers with high order value but also high return rates? 2. Create visualizations: ○ A map showing Revenue by Country ○ A line chart of Monthly Sales Trend ○ A bar chart showing Top 10 customers by Total Revenue ○ A table/heatmap showing Top returned products by country 3. Build a dashboard for business insights: ○ Allow filters for Country, Product, and Customer ID ○ Use KPIs for: ■ Total Revenue ■ Total Returns ■ Repeat Customer Count 4. Write a short business insight (2–3 sentences): Based on your Tableau dashboard, what recommendations would you make to help reduce churn and increase customer loyalty?\n"
